# The "Born2BeRoot" project from School 42 is a specific hands-on assignment or project that aims to teach students about Linux system administration and security practices. School 42, a renowned coding school with a unique pedagogical approach, often includes practical projects like Born2BeRoot to reinforce learning and skills development.

Here are some key aspects and objectives typically associated with the Born2BeRoot project:

Linux System Setup: Students are required to set up a Linux-based virtual machine (VM) or server from scratch. This involves installing and configuring a Linux distribution (such as Ubuntu or Debian) on a virtual environment.

System Hardening: The project focuses on system hardening techniques to secure the Linux environment against various threats and vulnerabilities. This includes tasks like:

Configuring firewall rules (using iptables or ufw) to control network traffic.
Managing user accounts and permissions effectively (e.g., setting up sudo privileges, managing password policies).
Securing SSH (Secure Shell) access by configuring SSH settings and keys.
Implementing security updates and patches to keep the system up-to-date.
Monitoring and Logging: Students may be required to set up monitoring tools and configure logging to track system activities and detect potential security incidents.

Documentation and Reporting: A crucial aspect of Born2BeRoot is documenting the setup, configurations, and security measures implemented. Students often need to provide detailed reports or documentation explaining their decisions and configurations.

Hands-On Learning: The project emphasizes practical, hands-on learning where students apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. By completing Born2BeRoot, students gain valuable experience in Linux system administration and security best practices.

The Born2BeRoot project is designed to challenge students and deepen their understanding of Linux systems while fostering skills in system administration and cybersecurity. It encourages students to think critically about security measures and the importance of securing systems against potential threats. The project is part of School 42's curriculum, which focuses on project-based learning and peer-to-peer education, preparing students for careers in software development and related fields.
